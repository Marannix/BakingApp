# BakingApp

Project Overview

You will productionize an app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

Why this Project?

As a working Android developer, you often have to create and implement apps where you are responsible for designing and planning the steps you need to take to create a production-ready app. Unlike Popular Movies where we gave you an implementation guide, it will be up to you to figure things out for the Baking App.

What Will I Learn?

In this project you will:

Use MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.

Handle error cases in Android.

Add a widget to your app experience.

Leverage a third-party library in your app.

Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.

App Description

Your task is to create a Android Baking App that will allow Udacityâ€™s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world. You will create an app that will allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.
